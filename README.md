# Nebulas Core Binary Packages

On the [dist](./dist) folder, you'll find two tar packages:

* **neb.tar.gz**: Contains only the precompiled binary neb. It's meant for users who already have everything setup and only need to speed up the compilation process.

* **nova.tar.gz**: Contains a pre-compiled binary along with two scripts meant to setup and run everything. It will install rocksdb (version 5.18.3), and will setup all the environment variables needed to run the node. You'll find more details inside the package.

Also, on the [src](./src) folder, you'll find the uncompressed files.
