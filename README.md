# Nebulas Core Binary Packages

This repo contains the binary packages needed to run a Nebulas node.

The project is still in development.

## Installation

You will find the binary packages in the /dist folder inside each version of Nebulas. For example, the current version is Nebulas Nova, so you will find the packages [here](Nova/dist).

### AppImage

This is a portable version of Nebulas, that can run out-of-the-box in any linux environment.

You need to download the .appimage, set the permissions to +x, and launch it.

#### Downloading

The current version of Nebulas is Nebulas Nova.

You can download the appimage just by [clicking here](https://arielbecker.com/assets/NebulasNova.AppImage).

#### Installing

There's no need to _install_ anything. You only need to set the file permissions to +x (executable).

In your desktop, open the folder where you have the .appimage. Copy the location (usually you can achieve this by pressing at the same time _CTRL_ and _L_, then _CTRL_ and _C_.

Now, open a console (or terminal). Write the following:

    cd (paste here the location you've copied before).

To paste the location, you usually need to press _CTRL_, _SHIFT_, and _P_ together.

Then, write the following (assuming your appimage file is NebulasNova.AppImage):

    chmod +x NebulasNova.AppImage

Done! Do not close the console yet. You'll need it for the next step.

#### Launching

Now, the only thing you need to do is launch the process. This can be achieved as easily as typing it:

    ./NebulasNova.AppImage

The first time you launch the .appimage, you'll see it copies several files to your user folder, then it launches the **neb** binary.

If everything's done right, you'll see something like this:

By launching it a second time, you'll have a prompt asking you to choose between four choices:

Choosing 0 will abort and quit. Choosing 1, 2, or 3 will launch the neb binary with the desired conf file: default.conf, miner.conf, or custom.conf. The latter is a file that you can edit to accomodate your needs; the first two are automatically generated by the script.

If you choose to execute the neb binary with either 1, 2, or 3, it should look like this:
